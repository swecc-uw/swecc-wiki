# So You Want a Software Engineering Internship

## Is it possible?

"The market is cooked", "Everyone's been coding since they were twelve", and many other variations are just some of the phrases you might hear among your peers.
While the number of software engineering jobs may be trending downwards, there are still plenty of internships and roles out there. You just have to prepare your time effectively to put yourself in the best position to get one. How? Well, that's what this guide is for – to hopefully help point you in the right direction.

## Alright, so how do I get one?

One of, if not _the_, key things that recruiters use to filter candidates is your resume. The parseability and readability of your resume is extremely important. It might look nice to create a document with fancy colors and cool pictures, but this is not what recruiters are looking for. They're looking for information about you – informative but quickly scannable.

<!-- and add a caption that says "Bad Design!" -->
<!-- also make these two images inline (together) -->

Notice how the second resume is much more readable and scannable than the first one. The first one has a lot of colors and images, while the second one is simple and easy to read, with clear sections and a consistent format. This is what you should aim for in your resume.
